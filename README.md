# Gaussian_naives_bayes
Implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from scratch in python. The data set(akk.csv) which contains the height,weight and age features. The test.csv contains the test data for which we would like to predict the class. I have also predicted the class without using the age feature in bayes_without_age.py.
